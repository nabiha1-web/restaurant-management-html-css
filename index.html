    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <div class="footer-dark">
      <p class="article-content">
        In 2018, three roommates—Aamna (22), Nabiha (23), and Shabano (25)—were
        trying to figure out what to do with their post-graduation lives. Aamna,
        who could barely cook, was lounging on the couch, scrolling through her
        phone and munching on chips. “Guys, I need something other than
        noodles,” Aamna complained, tossing a chip into her mouth. “But it has
        to be quick, like five minutes quick.” Shabano, the oldest and the neat
        freak, was cleaning the kitchen—again. “Aamna, how are you 22 and still
        don’t know how to make anything but instant ramen?” “I can make toast!”
        Aamna replied, shrugging. “It just burns sometimes.” Nabiha , the gossip
        queen and self-proclaimed "aunty" of the group, was sitting at the
        kitchen table reading a magazine, looked up from her magazine. “Aamna,
        we can’t live like this. Let’s cook something real for once.” Shabano’s
        eyes lit up. “I’ve got it. We’ll make steak. It’s simple but fancy.”
        Aamna raised an eyebrow. “Steak? Us?
      </p>

      <p class="article-content">
        Are we secretly millionaires now?” ShahBano was already pulling out the
        steaks. “It’s easy if you do it right. Just trust me.” Nabiha shot a
        glance at Aamna. “Aamna, you can’t even boil water. Are you really going
        to make a steak?” Aamna crossed her arms and pouted . “I’ll show you.
        You guys are just haters.” then immediately dropped the bag of chips on
        the floor. “Oops.” Nabiha and ShahBano exchanged a glance. “This is
        going to be a disaster,” Nabiha said, but with a grin. "I'm in. With
        ShahBano guiding the way, they seasoned the steak—Aamna literally
        throwing salt like it was confetti . “That’s way too much salt, Aamna!”
        Nabiha scolded, hands on her forehead. “Ugh, fine! I’ll just leave you two
        to do everything!” Aamna rolled her eyes dramatically, slumping into a
        chair. Nabiha sighed, but secretly, she was impressed. The steaks,
        despite the chaos, actually looked pretty good.
      </p>

      <p class="article-content">
        When they were finally done, they sat down to taste their creation.
        Aamna took the first bite. “Okay, not bad. This is actually...
        delicious. Who knew I had this in me?” Nabiha took a bite, still trying
        to act like she wasn’t impressed. “Well, for you, Aamna, this is a
        miracle.” ShahBano, who had been quietly watching the whole time, took a
        bite. “You know what? This is actually really good. It’s not perfect,
        but better than I expected.” They all looked at each other, grinning. It
        was official—their steak had turned out to be something special.
      </p>

      <p class="article-content">
        By 2020, The Whisk & Flame was born, their restaurant. Their signature
        dish? Le Bœuf Divin—a perfectly seared, French-style steak with a
        delicate touch of rosemary and garlic butter. Aamna became the
        restaurant's lively comedian, always joking with customers. Nabiha, the
        “aunty” of the group, handled the reservations with her insider
        knowledge, while ShahBano kept the kitchen spotless and ensured each
        steak was cooked to perfection. Customers didn’t just come for the
        steak; they came for the experience—good food, great banter, and a touch
        of chaos. As Aamna once said with a wink, “Who knew steak and sarcasm
        could make us famous?”
